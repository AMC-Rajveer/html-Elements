      <br><br> <b><i>The Fédération Internationale de Football Association</i></b>
        <strong>(lit. 'International Federation of Association Football')</strong>, more
        commonly known by its acronym <u>FIFA</u></i> (/ˈfiːfə/ FEE-fə), is the international self-regulatory governing body of association
        football, beach soccer, and futsal. It was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national
        associations of <em>Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain </em>(represented by the Madrid Football Club),
        Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations.
        These national associations must also be members of one of the six regional confederations: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and
        Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF <del>(& Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania)</del>, and CONMEBOL (South
        America).</p>

   <blockquote = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA><i><q>FIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each
national football association has one vote, regardless of size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in
ordinary sessions once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes
decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can
pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report and decides on the acceptance of new national
associations, and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its general secretary, and the other members
of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup</i></q></blockquote>
